##how to ensure the quality of a software system

SQA involves the entire software development PROCESS - monitoring and improving the process, making sure that any agreed-upon processes, standards and procedures are followed, and ensuring that problems are found and dealt with. Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is to establish a planned, systematic approach.Software quality assurance is to improve the prevention, detection and to ensure software quality. It manages software life cycle and verifies that the software meets the required quality and user needs. 

Here we will take the diandian (点点单词) as the target system to clarify how to ensure the software quality. There are some ways:

#####Test early and often
Where possible quality should be built in throughout the development life cycle rather than tested in at the end of a project. The most intuition way of SQA is software testing. This is an important part of the agile development process which we use when making our system. We test what we do, whether it’s design, code, or documentation, early and often so that defects are found while the work is still fresh in people’s minds and before the defects can become too deeply embedded in the software. 
Six types of functional testing can be used to ensure the quality of system. 
Ensure every line of code executes properly with Unit Testing.
Ensure every function produces its expected outcome with Functional Testing.
Ensure all functions combine to deliver the desired business result with System Testing. 
Ensure new changes did not adversely affect other parts of the system with Regression Testing. 
Ensure the system integrates with and does not adversely affect other enterprise systems with System Integration Testing. 
Ensure the customer is satisfied with the system with Acceptance Testing. 

#####Minimise variation
Any customisation of the software introduces variation which needs to be tested and maintained for every version of the app. Lean manufacturing has taught us that by minimising variation and developing apps which work for people out of the box we can reduce costs and more thoroughly test what we make, increasing the value of what we do for our clients. We recommend to our clients that they avoid paying us to customise our apps when possible so that we can provide them with the most cost efficient solution.

#####Build in flexibility
Where there is a common need for the same customisation from lots of clients we try to allow for this by building flexibility into the system. This limited and known variation can be accounted for when testing and does not add a huge cost overhead to our development process, while at the same time allowing our clients to change the things they need to.

#####Use great tools
Tools like Selenium and Jenkins enable us to run automated tests on our apps to ensure that any changes we make don’t break the existing features which our clients rely on. We continually make use of these tools throughout our development cycle.

#####Try out new ideas
We are always eager to learn about anything which might help us increase the quality and value of what we produce. Moving from the specification driven waterfall development model to the more flexible agile methodology was a big change for us, but adopting lean production methods is the thing that has given us the largest benefits.

Software quality is an extremely important issue throughout the lifetime of the software. It is the ultimate expression of the software development process using a variety of techniques to develop or validate methods. So we should pay special attention to the quality assurance in the lifetime of the diandian system to produce high-quality software products.
